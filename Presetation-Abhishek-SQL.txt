Q.) What is DDL, DML, DQL, TCL and DCL?
	DDL (Data Definition Language)
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	DDL or Data definition language is actually the definition or description of the database 
	structure or schema, it won't change the data inside the database. Create, modify, and delete 
	the database structures, but not the data.
	
	1.) CREATE
	__________

	Create the database or its object (ie table, index, view, function etc.).
	Syntax
	__________
	
	CREATE DATABASE databasename

	2.) DROP
	Drop command helps to delete the object from the database (ie table, index, view, function, etc.).
	
	Syntax
	DROP object object_name

	3.)ALTER
	Alter command is helpful to change or modify the structure of the database or its object.
	
	Syntax
	ALTER TABLE table_name
	ADD column_name datatype

	DML(Data Manipulation Language)
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	DML or Data Manipulation Language is to manipulate the data inside the database. With the help of DML
	 commands, we can insert, delete, change the data inside the database.

	1.) INSERT
	Insert command is helpful to insert the data into a table.

	Syntax
	INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
	VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...)

	2.) UPDATE

	Update command is helpful to update the existing data in a table.

	Syntax

	UPDATE table_name
	SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
	WHERE condition

	3.) DELETE

	Delete command helps to delete the records from a database table.

	Syntax
	DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;

	4.) LOCK 
	Lock command is helpful to lock the table to control concurrency.

	Syntax
	LOCK TABLE table-Name IN { SHARE | EXCLUSIVE } MODE


	DQL (Data Query Language)
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	DQL or data query language is to perform the query on the data inside the schema or object
	 (ie table, index, view, function, etc). With the help of DQL query we can get the data from 
	the database to perform actions or operations like analysing the data. 

	SELECT
	Select query on a table or tables to view the temporary table output from the database.

	Syntax
	Select * from Table_Name;


	DCL (Data Control Language)
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	DCL or Data Control Language is to provide rights, permissions, and other controls of the database system. 

	1.)  GRANT
	GRANT command is helpful to provide privileges to the database.

	Syntax
	GRANT privileges_names ON object TO user

	TCL (Transaction Control Language)
	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	TCL or Transaction Control Language happens to a transaction in the database.

	1.) COMMIT
	Commit command is to commit Transaction after insert or delete in the database.

	Syntax
	Commit;

	3.) ROLLBACK 
	Rollback command is to rollback a transaction in case of any error occurs.

	Syntax
	Rollback;



Q.)	Difference between Delete and Truncate?
ANS:-  DELETE
	1.)The delete statement is used to remove single or multiple records from an existing table
	 depending on the specified condition.
	2.)It is a DML (Data Manipulation Language) command.
	3.)It allows us to restore the deleted data by using the COMMIT or ROLLBACK statement.

	TRUNCATE
	1.) The truncate command removes the complete data from an existing table but not the table 
	    itself. It preserves the table structure or schema.
	2.) It is a DDL (Data Definition Language) command.
	3.) We cannot restore the deleted data after using executing this command.

Q.)	Difference between Delete and Drop?
	DELETE
	1.)The delete statement is used to remove single or multiple records from an existing table
	 depending on the specified condition.
	2.)It is a DML (Data Manipulation Language) command.
	
	DROPE
	1.)DROP Command, removes named elements of schema like relations/table, constraints or entire schema.
	2.)It is a DDL (Data Definition Language) command.

Q.)	Difference between Table and Field?
ANS:- A table has records (rows) and fields (columns). Fields have different types of data, such as text, numbers,
	 dates, and hyperlinks.

Q.)	Difference between Table and View?
ANS:- 1.)A table is a database object that holds information used in applications and reports. On the other hand,
	 a view is also a database object utilized as a table and can also link to other tables.
	
	2.)A table consists of rows and columns to store and organized data in a structured format, while the view is
	 a result set of SQL statements.

	3.)A table is structured with columns and rows, while a view is a virtual table extracted from a database.

	4.)The table is an independent data object while views are usually depending on the table.

Q.)	What is Alias?
ANS:-	SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name. Aliases are often used to make 
	column names more readable. An alias only exists for the duration of that query. An alias is created with the AS keyword.
